# Python-Development-Course
Welcome to my Python learning repository! This project documents my progress through the Code with Harry Python course, which spans 13 chapters and includes hands-on projects to reinforce key concepts. I'm currently on Chapter 5, and this repository contains all the code I've written so far.

Throughout the course, Iâ€™ve explored foundational Python topics such as variables, data types, functions, control flow, and more. Each chapter builds on the previous one, helping me strengthen my understanding step by step.

This repository serves as both a learning log and a showcase of my growing Python skills. ðŸš€
